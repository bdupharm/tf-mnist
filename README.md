# Tensorflow Model for Recognizing Handwritten Digits

Based on the tensorflow tutorial found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/tutorials/mnist/pros/index.html).

This projects aims to create a model that will accept new handwritten digits as input and make predictions.

Additionally, this projects aims to explain clearly what is going on at each point in the model.

## Installation
See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html#virtualenv-installation) for tensorflow installation instructions, we suggest you use a `virtualenv`.

## Running the Project
Run the basic neural network model w/ `./mnist_basic_nn.py`.

Run the convolutional neural network model w/ `./mnist_conv.py`.
